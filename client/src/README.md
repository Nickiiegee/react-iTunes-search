### • Introduction
This is an iTunes search app created to be able to search for any content (movie, music, podcasts, etc) on the platform.

### • Usage
You need to search a name of a song or movie, etc and also add the type of media to be able to see the content. Once you see what you are looking for, you can also add it to your 'favourite' tab for future reference.

### • Apps used
This iTunes search app was created using Reactjs and Expressjs. I used functional components to make code look cleaner.
